Note for users installing on Unix - you may need to install some additional libraries for Launchpad to run.
Simply run /Scripts/launchpad-dependencies.sh if your system is Debian or Debian-based, and it'll install them for you.

If you are not on a Debian-based system, you have to install these packages:
* libnotify-cil-dev
* libwebkitgtk-dev
